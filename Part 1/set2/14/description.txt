Purpose of this exercise: learn to apply a standard type in a non-standard way.

Design a program showing all combinations of all the program's command line
arguments (not using the program name itself). Each combination should be 
displayed on a numbered line. The first line should be empty (none of the 
arguments are shown), the last one should show all the program's arguments.
