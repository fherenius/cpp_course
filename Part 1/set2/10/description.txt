Basic exercise
Purpose of this exercise (letters): learn to determine sets of characters

(Extended) ascii characters fit in bytes (having 8 bits). 
In the header file ctype.h characters can be inspected for all 
kinds of characteristics (e.g., using functions like isspace to test 
whether a character is a space character) (cf. isspace(3)).
Not assuming anything about the ordering or position of 
letters in the ascii character set, fill a std::string with all 
letters found in the ascii character set. 

The program described by all_letters.cc iterates over the range
{0, 256} with the upper end being the number of encodings
contained by the extended ascii table. 
Using casting (size_t to char), and the checks 
isalpha() (checks if char is alphabetic) from ctype.h 
all letters are detected and appended to a string.
Finally, the string is printed (and redirected into out.txt)
