1. Is this a valid C++ program?

int main()
{}
	
It is valid, but it would not make sense because the program would
 not do anything.

2. Is this a valid C++ program?

int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])
{}
        
The code above is invalid, the char *envp[] is considered bad practice. 
Rather, the global variable extern char **environ should be used.


3. Is this a valid C++ program?

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    return;
}
        
It would not compile because the return type of main is int. 
To fix this you could return 0, 
or leave it out which defaults to returning 0.

4. Is this a valid C++ expression, and is it true?

sizeof('c') == 1

Yes it is valid and true, the size of a character in C++ is always one.

5. In main(int argc, char *argv[]) it is true that argv[argc] == 0. 

True, argv[argc] is equal to 0.

6. To immediately end a program from deep inside its code 
exit(0) should be used. 

Invalid. exit() is deprecated and therefore should not be used.

7. When defining an enum called Name start with enum Name, 
instead of using typedef enum Name. 

True, typedef is supported but not needed in C++ as opposed to C.

8. When writing argv[2][3] the resulting code evaluates index [2] before index [3].
 
True, the [] operator is left-to-right associative.
