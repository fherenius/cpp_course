hello.o  --> Object file (machine code) that the compiler generates. 
                 This file might contain references to external sources (cout, for example).
				 These references need to be linked against other object files (or libraries).
                 By linking these references, the executable file is created.
                 If multiple object files are compiled, then these multiple object files will be linked and produce a single executable file.
				 
hello   --> An executable is a file that the computer can directly execute.
               This file contains the memory addresses references for the external references it contains.
