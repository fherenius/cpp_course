1) show how you can call Derived::hello. 
Provide a clear explanation why this is bad practice.

In main.cc we provide a function caller which expects a Base object
and calls the hello method from the Derived class by casting the pointer
to a pointer of type Derived. This is bad practice because this only works
of the object received by caller is actually an instance of a Derived object,
otherwise the program may exhibit undefined behaviour.
