Basic exercise
Purpose of this exercise: learn to use the chrono/clock facilities

Using the now function (available in chrono, display the current
 local and universal coordinated time (use gmtime for that).

Your program should also receive an argument: an integral number to 
which an s, m, h (for seconds, minutes, hours) is appended. 
Add (or subtract) the specified time (from now), and display the resulting time.

Use put_time to display the resulting times.
