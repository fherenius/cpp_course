Exercise 32.
Basic exercise
Purpose: learn to use containers to solve complex tasks.

Construct a program that prints a sorted list of all different words appearing 
at its standard input. In this exercise, use a liberal definition of a `word':
 a word is defined as any series of characters not containing white space 
 (i.e., you can simply extract std::string values from std::cin)
  to get the `words'.
