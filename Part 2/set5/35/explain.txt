Purpose of this exercise: learn to handle pointers the smart way.

Same (!) exercise as the previous one, but now we keep the requirement that 
the strings themselves are reached via pointers. 
In addition to the implementations requested in the previous exercise, 
also provide the implementations of the operator[] members 
(make sure to handle COW correctly).
