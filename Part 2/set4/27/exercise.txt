Purpose of this exercise: learn to use escalation.
In the exercises about overloading we encountered the enum class Msg. This 
enum is used in a class Handler, where it is only available to the members of 
Handler. It is also used in a class Processor, where it is also only available 
to the members of the that class.

The classes Handler and Processor can be very simple. Submit the class 
interfaces of these classes as well as any other code you wrote to construct 
the classes' interfaces
