1) Show how you can destroy the already allocated objects once you've caught
the exception and explain why the solution is (so) simple.

we created a class MaxFour that has a static variable s_nMaxFour that keeps
track of the number of MaxFour objects that are created. when more than 4 are
created an error is thrown. When the main function is run, the following output
is produced:

1 MaxFour objects created
2 MaxFour objects created
3 MaxFour objects created
4 MaxFour objects created
Destructor called
Destructor called
Destructor called
Destructor called
max. number of objects reached

After 4 created objects the constructor throws an error, then all previously
created objects are destroyed because all objects created within a try-block
are destroyed before thrown error. We therefore don't have to destory ourself.
