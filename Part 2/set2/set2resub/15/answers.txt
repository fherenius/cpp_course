1) Explain why exit calls should be avoided in C++ programs,
and why exceptions are a better alternative.

exit should be avoided because it immediately terminates the program and
therefore destructors of local objects aren't activated. This results in 
memory leaks. Destructors of global objects do get activated when exit is
called however.

Exceptions form a better alternative because:

- exit() terminates the program, whereas with exception you can still recover
- destructors arent activated with exit() resulting in memory leaks. which
isn't the case for exceptions.
- With exceptions we can break the programs normal control flow without
having cascading return statements

In our program when we run throwException the output is

Constructor called
Exception
Destructor called

whereas with hardExit the output is

Constructor called

and we lose 8 bytes of memory. This is because with exit() the local 
destructors are not activated
