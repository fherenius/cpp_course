Design an interactive program (just one main function) in which you repeatedly
request user input. The input consists of numbers, one number per line. To 
end the program enter a single q.

Part of the code of the program handling the normal input is:


    while (true)
    {
        cout << "please enter a number: ";
        getline(cin, line);
        if (line == "q") 
        {
            cout << "leaving...\n";
            return 0;
        }
        cout << stod(line) << '\n';
    }
        
and the string line is defined at the top of main's body.
However, invalid input may be entered, resulting in the following interaction:


    please enter a number: ok
    `ok' is not a number
    please enter a number: 12
    12
    please enter a number: -13
    -13
    please enter a number: 1e4
    10000
    please enter a number: oops
    `oops' is not a number
    please enter a number: -1.5
    -1.5
    please enter a number: q
    leaving...
        
Clearly, 'ok' is not a number and neither is 'oops'.
Without modifying the provided code snippet in any way, submit main's 
implementation resulting in interactions like the one shown above.
