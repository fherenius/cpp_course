The purpose of this exercise is to learn to use Semaphores to synchronize
multiple threads.

Currently the implementation is not working, it seems I'm failing to use the 
static wrapper function properly. The adresses of my Semaphores in the worker
object suddenly change location after construction and being passed to a 
detached thread. This causes multiple threads to wait for eachother because
the semaphores aren't being updated properly. 

Hopefully the feedback will give a hint to where I'm going wrong, I must be
missing some basic concept.
