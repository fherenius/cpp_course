The purpose of this exercise is to learn to use Semaphores to synchronize
multiple threads.

Current implementation works, the Storage class was already given in week7
but I've still added it into order.txt because I added a member function.

Given only 2 worker threads are started in total, I tracked them by
hand. In case more worker threads were necessary, a vector of objects,
a vector of threads, and some functions to start all threads and join all
threads would have been used. In this case, I thought it would be a bit 
overkill.

JB: See my comments in the code. Perhaps I'm on to something.
FPJ: Thanks, they helped a lot. It works for me now! :)
