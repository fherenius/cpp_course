Purpose of this exercise: learn to use promotion with generic algorithms and 
predefined function objects when manipulating basic data types.
Use sort to sort the command line's arguments twice, once ascending, once 
descending without storing them in a vector.

Use only features from the STL. Your program should call sort and copy twice. 
These calls and newline insertions into cout should be the only statements 
in main.

The program defines no variables (main's parameters are OK).
