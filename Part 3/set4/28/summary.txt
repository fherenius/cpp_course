Summary:

Design a trait class expecting a template argument.
It might be a plain type, pointer to a type, reference to a type
or an rvalue reference to a type.

The trait class should define a value which has a value for the 4 variants.
This value is 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

Also show (using a template function) how you can define a const ptr to an
int using `auto ptr = ...`. Once it is available, let it point to a plain int
variable and show its value by dereferencing it.
