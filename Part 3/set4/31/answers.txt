//JB: 1

Summary:

Given the following statement,

    v1 + v2 + v3 + v4;

answer the following questions given that vi's are vectors of ints and an
Expression template has been defined to add them together.

Q. What is the result of the statement given above?

A. The result is a temporary Expression object.
   That holds Another Expression object and the vector v4.
   The hierarchy can be drawn as follows.


   v1    v2
   |     |
   +--+--+
      |
     Expr1      v3
      |         |
      +----+----+
           |
          Expr2      v3
           |         |
           +----+----+
                |
               Expr3
    
    Expr3 is then the resulting temporary Expression object.


Q. How many index computations will be performed?

//JB: >:-)=)>~
A. Trick question as the statement will perform no index computations.
   The index computations are only performed by the Expression object once
   it is interpreted as a vector<int>. Since the statement never does that it
   will not perform the computations.
