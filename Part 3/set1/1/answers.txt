Purpose of this exercise: Show that the compiler doesn't make files bigger
                          than necessary.

The files being compiled as followed: 
g++ -Wall -Werror -std=c++20 -c main.cc source1.cc source2.cc

Then being linked into an output file as follows:
g++ -o out1 main.o source1.o
g++ -o out2 main.o source2.o 

Gives the following output:

out1
Location of function in main: 0x5647e50bf237
Adress of template pointer: 0x5647e50bf237

out2
Location of function in main: 0x564e5b7d4237
Adress of template pointer: 0x564e5b7d4237

As seen above, both functions in the union in fun() and in main() refer to the
same template function. Meaning the compiler recognised justReturn() indicates
the same function and the compiler makes sure it doesn't occur in memory more
than is strictly necessary.
