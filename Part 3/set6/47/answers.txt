JB: But see below.

The goal of this exercise is to explain the working of the FSA coroutine from
the Annotations.

We used the reference implementation of the Annotations and commented it to show
understanding of how a coroutine works. The classes Awaiter, Start and 
PromiseBase were commented, the other classes are mostly identical to Start.

JB: You do a nice job of explaining in the classes how coroutines are used to
    make this work. That kind of was the exercise. I feel I'm nitpicking a bit,
    but a maintainable version of this code would also at least briefly document
    *what* the program/class intends to accomplish - e.g. mention that your are
    implementing a FSA, and that several awaiters implement a state each.
    Since the fix is easy and I wish to save myself some extra work, full pts
    here already, but please do fix in other exercise(s) where comment is
    explicitely mentioned.
