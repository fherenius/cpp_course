Summary:

Create a struct template that offers basic implementation of required
coroutine State (promise_type) functions.
Show the implementation in the handler class from the previous exercise (44).


Q. Explain what you would do if a default implementation cannot be used.

A. Since the PromiseBase is never used in functions or anywhere for that matter
   outside of the derived class, we can override the functions that need a
   special implementation just by declaring them in the derived class.
   These new functions will then be called in the context of the derived class.
