The goal of this exercise was to deal with #include files, much like how the
C++ language deals with these. Files to be included are copied directly into
the file being processed.

The above was realised using the available pushStream and popStream members
to switch input and process included files in the correct order, also
when nested. These members already provide the correct error messages when a
file does not exist.
