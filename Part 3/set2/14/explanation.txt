The purpose of this exercise is to implement our own iterator in template class.

We used the method as described in the book, where we have an iterator class
that is used in the Storage class. The implementation has been adapted to
work with gcc-12 since inheriting from std::iterator has been deprecated.

Unfortunately, the reverse iterator does not work yet.
